            <p><b>trembeats.fm</b> is the first Ukrainian-spoken radio in Germany. Here people can listen to modern
                Ukrainian
                music, interesting interviews about the latest social and cultural changes in Ukraine and get useful
                information about the life in Germany (i.e consular advice with a lawyer).
                <br><br>
                Project visualization should attract the attention of the new site users and listeners. Modern
                appearance is
                an important aspect which corresponds to the content of radio shows.

                <br>There are some visual markers that customer would like to keep in new visual communication:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Ukraine:</b> national colors, a man in national costume with an ornament.<br>
                <b>Trembita:</b> an alpine wooden horn. It is common among Ukrainian highlanders.<br>
                <b>Radio:</b> realistic old radio illustration, ".fm" domain is written twice.<br>
                <br><br>
                In contemporary world, especially in Germany, it would be much better to use abstract metaphors.

            <p>Therefore, in many places, kerning was <b>improved</b>, the upper extension lines were lowered, all bevels were
                made at angles of 0°, 90° and 34° degrees, in order to give greater <b>readability</b> and presence of <b>rhyme</b>
                with the style-forming element.
